# Day 7: Burger King Voice Ordering Assistant 🍔👑

**Overview**

Today I built a shopping assistant for my favorite food ordering platform: **Burger King**!

For the primary goal:
✅ Created a sample catalog in JSON format (including deals like "Whopper Meal Deal").
✅ The bot understands user intent (items, quantities, or "ingredients for X").
✅ It adds items to a cart and tracks the order throughout the conversation.
✅ Final orders are "placed" by saving them to a JSON file.

I built this voice agent using the **fastest TTS API - Murf Falcon** to ensure a snappy, "flame-grilled" response time! ⚡️

I am participating in the **Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge**.
